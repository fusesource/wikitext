	<h3>Offline Reports</h3>
	<br>
	
	<p>Bugzilla has the ability to save bugs offline on your hard-drive from both the bug editor and the 
	New Bug Wizard. The Offline Reports View is where the saved bug reports can be accessed. To show the 
	offline reports menu without saving a new bug, go to Window --> Show View --> Other... --> Bugzilla 
	and click on Bugzilla Offline Reports. To open an offline bug, simply double-click it.
