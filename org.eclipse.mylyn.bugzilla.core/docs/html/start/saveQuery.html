	<h3>Save Query</h3>
	<br>

	<p>
	There is a pair of buttons in the middle of the search dialog that allow you
	to save frequently used queries and run these saved queries.  The "Remember..." button
	will save the current query, and the "Saved Queries..." button will display
	a list of saved queries that you can choose from.
    </p>

	<p>
	When the "Remember..." button is clicked, a dialog will be displayed asking
	you to name the query.  Once "OK" is clicked, the query will be saved locally.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you try to name a new query with an name that already exists, you will be prompted
	asking whether to overwrite the currently saved query with the new one.
	</p>

	When the "Saved Queries..." button is clicked on, another dialog will be displayed
	containing a list of all of the queries that are currently saved on your computer.  Select
	the query that you wish to run and click "run" to execute it.
