	<h3>Bugzilla Editor</h3>
	<br>

	<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is required that you have entered your Bugzilla login name and password
	into the Bugzilla plugin preferences if you wish to create new bugs.
	</p>

	<p>The bug editor is opened when you view a bug.  Here, you can edit the bug and submit the changes.  
	Once you are finished modifying the bug, you can click the "Submit" button at the
	bottom of the editor to submit it to the Bugzilla server.  Also, if you have made
	changes to the bug, you can click the "Compare" button to inspect any changes between
	your version of the bug and the online version.
	</p>

	<p>You can save the current version of the bug offline on your 
	hard-drive using Ctrl+s or File -&gt; Save. The locally saved bug report will be accessible from the Offline Reports View. Any
	time you try to view a bug with this id, your offline copy will be shown instead of the one
	from the server.  You can continue to make and save changes until you either delete the offline
	version or submit your changes to the server.
	</p>
	<p>At the top of the editor, there is a hyperlink that says &quot;Open in 
	browser&quot;.&nbsp; This will open the current bug in the default web browser 
	specified in eclipse.&nbsp; This is useful for if the bug editor does not 
	currently support an option that you wish to use such as voting.&nbsp; If 
	you wish to have the bug editor close and the web browser open, you can 
	Alt+click on the link.</p>


	<img src="./images/existing-bug-editor.png"><br>
	
	<p>A bug saved from the New Bug Wizard will open in a simpler editor, since it does
	not yet exist on a server, and so there are fewer tasks you can perform on it. 
	The most notable change is that there is no button to allow you to compare it with 
	the online version.
	and the only action is to submit the report to the server.
