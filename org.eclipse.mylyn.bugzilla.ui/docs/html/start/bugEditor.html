	<h3>Bugzilla Editor</h3>
	<br>

	<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is required that you have entered your Bugzilla login name and password
	into the Bugzilla plugin preferences if you wish to create new bugs.
	</p>

	<p>The bug editor is opened when you view a bug.  Here, you can edit the bug and submit the changes.  
	Once you are finished modifying the bug, you can click the "Submit" button at the
	bottom of the editor to submit it to the Bugzilla server.  Also, if you have made
	changes to the bug, you can click the "Compare" button to inspect any changes between
	your version of the bug and the online version.
	</p>

	<p>If you click the "Save" button, you will save the current version of the bug offline on your 
	hard-drive. The locally saved bug report will be accessible from the Offline Reports View. Any
	time you try to view a bug with this id, your offline copy will be shown instead of the one
	from the server.  You can continue to make and save changes until you either delete the offline
	version or submit your changes to the server.
	</p>

	<p>A bug saved from the New Bug Wizard will open in a simpler editor, since it does
	not yet exist on a server, and so there are fewer tasks you can perform on it. 
	The most notable change is that there is no button to allow you to compare it with 
	the online version.
