	<h3>Bugzilla New Bug Wizard</h3>
	<br>
	
	<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is required that you have entered your Bugzilla login name and password
	into the Bugzilla plugin preferences if you wish to create new bugs.
	</p>

	<p>This Bugzilla plugin allows you to submit new bugs.  To do this, go to "File->New->Other..."
	and then choose "Bugzilla Wizards" and "New Bug Report".
	</p>

	<p>When you click "Next", you will be presented with a dialog that contains the list
	of products that you can submit a bug for.  Choose the product that you wish to submit
	the bug for and click "Next".  If there is only one product to choose from, then this
	screen will be skipped over automatically.
	</p>

	<p>Now, you can modify the required attributes for the new bug.  When you are finished,
	you can submit the bug to the server.  To do so, select "Submit bug report to the server."
	and click the "Finish" button.  This will submit your new bug to the server.  If no
	problems occured, the new bug will be opened in a Bugzilla editor so that you can review
	your submission.
	</p>

	<p>Alternatively, you can save the bug offline on your hard-drive.  Select "Save bug 
	report offline." and click the "Finish" button.  The locally saved bug report will be 
	accessible from the Offline Reports View.</p>
