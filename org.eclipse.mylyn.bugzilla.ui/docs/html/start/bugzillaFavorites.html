	<h3>Bugzilla Favorites</h3>
	<br>

	<p>
	Bugzilla has the ability to save bugs that are frequently accessed as a favorite
	similar to a web browser.  To do this, after a search is done right click on the bug
	in the Search results window that you would like to save and choose "Mark Result as Favorite".&nbsp; 
	Favorites can also be added through the context menu in the bug editor.</p>

	<p>
	A new window will now open that contains your specific list of favorites.  To access
	any of the bugs in the favorites view, just double click on the one that you want to
	open and a Bugzilla bug editor will open containing the specific bug.  To access the favorites
	menu without adding a new bug, go to Window --> Show View --> Other... --> Bugzilla and click
	on Bugzilla Favorites.
