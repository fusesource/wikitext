	<h3>Searching Reports</h3>
	<br>

	<p>
   	A Bugzilla Search tab has also been added to the Eclipse Search pane. You can enter
	a bug ID or keywords in the text field and, if desired, limit the
	search by selecting particular attributes that the bug must have. 
	Press Enter or click "Search" to proceed with the query to the Bugzilla server.&nbsp;
    	</p>
	<p>
   	<i>Note:</i>
	There is an update button near the bottom of the Bugzilla search dialog.  
	When this button is clicked, it will query the Bugzilla server for new 
	options.  These options	are for the bug attributes such as milestone, product, etc.  
	This allows Bugzilla to contain the latest information so that you can
	perform a better search.
    	</p>

    <p>
	If a Bugzilla ID was entered, that particular bug report will open in
	the Bugzilla bug viewer.

	<p>
	If a bug id was not entered, the results will appear in the Search results tab.
	From here, you can open any of the items by double-clicking on them.
    	</p>

	<p>
	By default, all of the results are sorted by Bug ID. They can also be sorted by 
	priority, severity, or status. To change the way the items are sorted, right-click 
	any bug and choose from the "Sort By" submenu.

	Previous Bugzilla queries are accessible through the drop-down
	history menu at the right end of the view's toolbar.
