<h3><a name="setup">Workspace setup</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Building Mylar feature from HEAD requires
		the latest Eclipse milestone release and
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">JDK 1.5</a>.&nbsp; 
		Associate the J2SE-1.5 with your installed JRE on the Execution Environments preference page. </li>
		<li>In the CVS Repositories view, add the following CVS location:
		<b>HOST =</b> dev.eclipse.org&nbsp; <b>Repository Path</b>: 
		/home/technology.<br>If you do not have an account you may enter <b>anonymous</b> for the user name 
and leave the password blank.</li>
		<li>Check out all of the projects under org.eclipse.mylar (except myar.aspectj, 
		mylar.sandbox, mylar.viz, and mylar.zest.* which have additional 
		dependencies).&nbsp; There should be no errors or warnings.</li>
		<li>Run org.eclipse.mylar.tests.AllTests as a JUnit Plug-in Test, all 
		tests should pass and there should be no console output.&nbsp; The tests 
		workbench window can be in the foreground or background, but should not 
		be interacted with during the test execution.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><a name="writingPatches">Writing patches</a> </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>All changes to Mylar should be made using the latest development 
		release of Mylar, and need to have a corresponding bug report activated.&nbsp; 
		</li>
		<li>Synchronzie often to ensure you have the latest code.&nbsp; Once you 
		start modifying resources, put the Synchronize view in Outgoing mode and press 
		the Change Set button so that Mylar tracks the context for the patch.</li>
		<li>For most patches, a failing unit test should be written first.&nbsp; 
		Before creating a new JUnit test class class check the components test 
		suite (e.g. <tt>AllTasklistTests</tt>) for similar test cases (e.g. 
		<tt>AllTasklistTests.suite()</tt>).</li>
		<li>Set the formatter by importing org.eclipse.mylar/developer/javaFormatterSettings.xml 
		into Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Code Style -&gt; Formatter.&nbsp; 
		Format code using Eclipse's formatter (Ctrl+Shift+F) 
		and ensure that no&nbsp; have been added.</li>
		<li>Minimize the amount of changes to existing code to make review 
		easier.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>To submit a patch<ul>
		<li>Ensure there are no build errors, warnings, or <tt>println(..)</tt> 
		calls, and that <tt>org.eclipse.mylar.tests.AllTests</tt> passes.</li>
		<li>Synchronize using Incoming mode and ensure that there are no 
		conflicts, and merge them locally if there are.</li>
		<li>Right click the task context change set, create the patch, and 
		attach it to the bug report</li>
	</ul>
		</li>

<p>Mylar will will not be </p>
<p>Officially, Mylar can't promise any APIs until the 1.0 release. We're a 
technology project that's exploring novel functionality, and the user interface 
and interaction need to stabilize considerably more before APIs can follow suit.<br>
<br>
However, for those willing to innovate on the bleeding edge (hi Brock ;), we are 
starting to form the very initial, and guaranteed to change, APIs for task and 
repository integration. I expect that these will become a bit more stable by 
Mylar 0.5. And yes, making the Jira support part of Mylar is on the table, in 
order to make that better integrated, easier to contribute to, and have it 
evolve gracefully along with the formation of the APIs. I'll post more regarding 
that on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mylar 0.4.7 has preliminary support for multiple repositories, and the 
Bugzilla plug-in extends this via some very preliminary APIs and extension 
points. However, there is considerably more work that needs to go into improving 
and eventually stabilizing those APIs and extension points. Currently the only 
guarantee is that they need to change over the next few weeks, with JIRA support 
as the current driver. We're using the following report to track progress on 
this, so add yourself to the CC list (it's a bit of a monster with 35 comments, 
but summarizes the current thinking): <br>
