<blockquote>
	<h4>Workspace Setup</h4>- Building Mylar feature from HEAD requires 
	<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.2M4-200512151506/">Eclipse 
		SDK 3.2M4</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">JDK 1.5</a>.&nbsp; 
	<br><br>- To get the Mylar source code, in the CVS Repositories view, add the following CVS location: 
	<b>HOST =</b> dev.eclipse.org&nbsp; <b>Repository Path</b>: 
		/home/technology.<br>If you do not have an account you may enter <b>anonymous</b> for the user name 
and leave the password blank.<p>- Check out all of the projects under org.eclipse.mylar (except mylar.aspectj, 
		mylar.sandbox, mylar.viz, and mylar.zest which have additional 
		dependencies).</p>
	<h4>Building from HEAD</h4>- Associate the J2SE-1.5 with your installed JRE on the Execution Environments preference page.
	<br>
	<h4>Building the Eclipse 3.1 Branch</h4>- Right-click the org.eclipse.mylar.java, mylar.ide, and mylar.xml
		project, Team -&gt; Switch to Another Branch..., then 
		Refresh the Branches and select e_3_1 </p>
	<h4>The Initial Test</h4>
	<p>-

Now that you have the source, the first thing to do is confirm that it all compiles without failing any of the unit tests.
In the <i>org.eclipse.mylar.tests</i> project there is a test suite class (<i>org.eclipse.mylar.tests.AllTests</i>) that aggregates all tests in the Mylar project.
	Note that this test must be run as a <b>JUnit Plug-in Test</b>. Execution of this test suite should result in a 
	<b><font color="#008000">GREEN</font></b> bar 
	(no failures) and there should not be any output in the console view as a 
result of running these tests. The HEAD repository is maintained so that it 
always passes this test suite.</p>

<h3><a name="writingPatches">Writing Patches</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>- Write a failing unit test first (see <a href="#writingTests">Writing 
	Tests</a> below).</p>
	<p>- Try to minimize the amount of changes to existing code. </p>
	<p>- Synchronize when patches have been applied so that you don't have a 
merge/synchronize problem. Using the Synchronize view in Incoming Mode
	<img border="0" src="../images/developer/IncomingChanges.jpg">, you can 
	update your local copy of the source with the most recent changes to the 
	Mylar source repository. Synchronize frequently when working and prior to 
	submitting a patch.</p>

<a name="writingTests"><h3>Writing Tests</h3>
</a></p>

<blockquote>

- Mylar is maintained using test driven development. When writing patches, each 
added feature in the patch must be accompanied by a test case.<br>You will notice that most packages in the Mylar code base have an associated 
test package. For example, the unit tests for the <i>org.eclipse.mylar.tasklist</i> 
package are located in the<br><i>org.eclipse.mylar.tasklist.tests</i> package. Within these '<i>tests</i>' 
packages you will find a single test suite class that should reference all unit 
tests within that package. In the case of our chosen example the class <i>AllTasklistTests.java</i> does the job. If a new unit test is added 
to this package, a reference to the new unit test must be added to <i>AllTasklistTests.java</i>.<p>- Where unit tests already cover code related to 
your own, try to add test cases to these existing unit tests rather than 
creating entirely new classes.</p>
<p>- Mylar Active Plug-in Suite is a run environment for executing all unit 
tests currently within your active Mylar task context. By setting one of these 
run environments you can quickly execute whatever tests you are currently 
working on.</p>

<a name="submittingPatches"><h3>Submitting Patches</h3></a>
	<blockquote>
		<p>- Before patching check the Synchronize view in OUTGOING mode (press 
		Change Set button to enable change set mode) to see what you have 
		added/changed.<br>
		Look over you code in this view for extraneous debug code such as <i>
		System.out.println</i> etc. [Note that by right-clicking on the change 
		set you can create patches from this view.]</p>
		<p>- Eliminate all problems (Problems view) before submitting.</p>
		<p>- The <i>org.eclipse.mylar.tests.AllTests </i>test suite must pass before submitting the patch.</p>
		<p>- When using Bugzilla, open the bug report and submit the patch using 
		the &quot;Create New Attachment&quot; link. Specify the patch file and denote it 
		as a patch. Add any pertinent comments.</p>
