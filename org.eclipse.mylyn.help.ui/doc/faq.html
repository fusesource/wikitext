	<h3><a name="install-failure">Why does Mylar fail to install or update?</a></h3>
<p>The most likely reason is that you are using an <b>incompatible VM </b>(e.g. JDK 
1.4), in which case you'll errors like the following in your log file.&nbsp; To 
check JDK version that Eclipse was launched with to to Help -&gt; About Eclipse SDK 
-&gt; Configuration Details and verify that the java.vm.version is 1.5.&nbsp; Mac 
users should refer to the last
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=116347#c4">bug 1163477</a> 
for instructions on how to change the 1.4 default.</p>
<p>
<pre>   Root exception:
   java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/eclipse/mylar/tasklist/MylarTasklistPlugin 
   (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)</pre>
</p>
<p>
This can also be the result of using an <b>incompatible version of Eclipse</b>.&nbsp; 
Separate versions and update sites exist
<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">for Eclipse 3.1 and for the latest 3.2 
milestone</a>), in which case you'll see errors like the following in your 
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.log file or in a Mylar view:</p>
<p>
<pre>   java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
   org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.FilteredTree.getFilterControl()Lorg/eclipse/swt/widgets/Text;

   org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The activator org.eclipse.mylar.java.MylarJavaPlugin for bundle org.eclipse.mylar.java is invalid
</pre>
</p>
<p>In this case the easiest thing to do is reinstall Mylar.&nbsp; <b>Your tasks won't be 
lost</b>, by default they are stored in the &lt;workspace&gt;/.mylar/tasklist.xml file 
which will be read next time Mylar starts.&nbsp;First, uninstall the old version of Mylar using Help -&gt; 
Software Updates -&gt; Manage Configuration.&nbsp; You need to first Disable on all 
Mylar features by right-clicking them, allow Eclipse to restart after the last 
is disabled, and after restart.&nbsp; Then ensure that the 3rd toolbar button is 
pressed (figure below) so that you see the disabled features to uninstall, and 
Uninstall them using the popup menu.&nbsp; If you don't uninstall the the Update 
Manager will think that you have the latest and tell you that there are no 
updates. Note that manually removing the plug-ins 
and features can lead to Eclipse configuration errors. After uninstalling update Eclipse 
by adding the correct update site specified at: 
	<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php</a>, 
and after that automatically or manually updating will install the correct 
version.</p>

<h3><a name="tasklist-blank">Why did my tasks disappear?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
<p>Either because Mylar failed to <a href="#install-failure">install or update</a>, 
or because there was a problem reading the task list.&nbsp; By default Mylar 
keeps your task list in &lt;workspace&gt;/.mylar/tasklist.xml.&nbsp; If you move 
workspaces, and have not changed the Mylar data directory via the Task List 
preference page, the new location will be used when Eclipse restarts (hit 
Restore Defaults on that page to copy tasks back to the default location).&nbsp; 
If your tasks ever disappear please
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mylar">report this 
as a critical bug</a>, and check the .mylar folder for a tasklist-backup.xml 
file, which will contain the previous state task list.&nbsp; Make sure to copy 
it somewhere it before adding any tasks or queries or restarting Eclipse because 
it will get overwritten on any modification.</p>
	<p>If your workspace folder is not backed up it is a good idea to either 
	backup the tasklist.xml file manually or periodically use File -&gt; 
	Import/Export -&gt; &nbsp;Other -&gt; Mylar Task Data.&nbsp; Note that when restoring 
	an previous tasklist.xml file you should first close Eclipse.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><a name="performance-summary">What are the effects of Mylar on Eclipse 
performance?</a></h3>
<p>The goal is for Mylar to have no noticeable effect on Eclipse's speed or 
memory usage, and any performance issue should be
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mylar">reported as 
a bug</a>.&nbsp; The current performance profile is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mylar only runs if a task is active, and has no impact on Eclipse if no 
	task is active.</li>
	<li>Task context models have negligible memory overhead.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The time to activate a task context is dominated by the time it takes 
	Eclipse to open the editors in the context.&nbsp; You can set the preference 
	for how many editors to open in the Mylar preference page (e.g. setting to 1 
	will dramatically reduce activation time).&nbsp; You can also turn off 
	editor management entirely in the Mylar Tasks view pull-down.</li>
	<li>Eclipse startup is slowed down by (3) if a task is active when Eclipse 
	is shut down.</li>
</ol>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><a name="filtering-declarations">How do I stop declarations from showing up in the Package Explorer?</a></h3>
<p>If you don't like Mylar's constant showing of Java members in the 
			Package Explorer, select the drop-down menu, then &quot;Filters...&quot; and 
			enable the &quot;Mylar Java Declarations Filter&quot;.&nbsp; It will then 
			stick in the menu in case you want to toggle between modes.&nbsp; 
Note that this will hide interest information about members that aren't in your 
current file (e.g. showing you which methods are landmarks) so this mode is not 
recommended, but can be useful for 1024x768 screen resolutions.</p>

			<h3><a name="active-search-empty">Why does nothing show up in the Active Search or Active Hierarchy?</a></h3>
			<p>
			As you work and elements become landmarks (bold decoration), and 
			these elements populate the Active Search and Active Hierarchy 
			views.&nbsp; To force an element to populate the views manually make 
			it a landmark by right-clicking or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow.&nbsp; </p></body></html>
