      Mylar Limitations
    </title>
  </head>

    <h1>
      Frequent Asked Questions</h1>
	<h3>What platforms are supported?</h3>
	<p>Mylar supports Eclipse 3.1 final and Eclipse 3.2 milestone releases.&nbsp; 
	For the time being Mylar <i>only runs in a Java 5 VM</i>, but we are 
	exploring support for JDK 1.4 VMs.</p>
	<h3>How do I stop declarations from showing up in the Package Explorer?</h3>
			If you don't like Mylar's constant showing of Java members in the 
			Package Explorer, select the drop-down menu, then &quot;Filters...&quot; and 
			enable the &quot;Mylar Java Declarations Filter&quot;.&nbsp; It will then 
			stick in the menu in case you want to toggle between modes.<p>

	<h3>
			Why does nothing show up in the Active Search or Active Hierarchy?</h3>
	<p>
			As you work and elements become landmarks (bold decoration), and 
			these elements populate the Active Search and Active Hierarchy 
			views.&nbsp; To force an element to populate the views manually make 
			it a landmark by right-clicking or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow.&nbsp; </p>
