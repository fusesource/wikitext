<h3><a name="install-failure">Why does Mylar fail to install, update, or show my 
tasks?</a></h3>
<p>The most likely reason is that you are using an <b>incompatible VM </b>(e.g. JDK 
1.4), in which case you'll errors like the following in your log file.&nbsp; To 
check JDK version that Eclipse was launched with to to Help -&gt; About Eclipse SDK 
-&gt; Configuration Details and verify that the java.vm.version is 1.5.&nbsp; Mac 
users should refer to the last
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=116347#c4">bug 1163477</a> 
for instructions on how to change the 1.4 default.</p>
<p>
<pre>   Root exception:
   java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/eclipse/mylar/tasklist/MylarTasklistPlugin 
   (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)</pre>
</p>
<p>
This can also be the result of using an <b>incompatible version of Eclipse</b>.&nbsp; 
Separate versions and update sites exist
<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">for Eclipse 3.1 and for the latest 3.2 
milestone</a>), in which case you'll see errors like the following in your 
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.log file or in a Mylar view:</p>
<p>
<pre>   java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
   org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.FilteredTree.getFilterControl()Lorg/eclipse/swt/widgets/Text;

   org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The activator org.eclipse.mylar.java.MylarJavaPlugin for bundle org.eclipse.mylar.java is invalid
</pre>
</p>
<p>In this case the easiest thing to do is reinstall Mylar.&nbsp; <b>Your tasks won't be 
lost</b>, by default they are stored in the &lt;workspace&gt;/.mylar/tasklist.xml file 
which will be read next time Mylar starts.&nbsp;First, uninstall the old version of Mylar using Help -&gt; 
Software Updates -&gt; Manage Configuration.&nbsp; You need to first Disable on all 
Mylar features by right-clicking them, allow Eclipse to restart after the last 
is disabled, and after restart.&nbsp; Then ensure that the 3rd toolbar button is 
pressed (figure below) so that you see the disabled features to uninstall, and 
Uninstall them using the popup menu.&nbsp; If you don't uninstall the the Update 
Manager will think that you have the latest and tell you that there are no 
updates. Note that manually removing the plug-ins 
and features can lead to Eclipse configuration errors. After uninstalling update Eclipse 
by adding the correct update site specified at: 
	<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php</a>, 
and after that automatically or manually updating will install the correct 
version.</p>

	<h3><a name="filtering-declarations">How do I stop declarations from showing up in the Package Explorer?</a></h3>
<p>If you don't like Mylar's constant showing of Java members in the 
			Package Explorer, select the drop-down menu, then &quot;Filters...&quot; and 
			enable the &quot;Mylar Java Declarations Filter&quot;.&nbsp; It will then 
			stick in the menu in case you want to toggle between modes.</p>

			<h3><a name="active-search-empty">Why does nothing show up in the Active Search or Active Hierarchy?</a></h3>
			<p>
			As you work and elements become landmarks (bold decoration), and 
			these elements populate the Active Search and Active Hierarchy 
			views.&nbsp; To force an element to populate the views manually make 
			it a landmark by right-clicking or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow.&nbsp; </p></body></html>
