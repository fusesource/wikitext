<h3><a name="configuration-eclipse">What is the recommended Eclipse 
configuration for running Mylar?</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Package Explorer<ul>
		<li>Use flat layout in the Package Explorer (local pull down -&gt; Layout 
		-&gt; Flat).&nbsp; Hierarchical layout is not supported.</li>
		<li>Link the Package Explorer with the editor (toolbar -&gt; Link with 
		Editor).&nbsp; With Mylar applied this won't cause the jumping around 
		problems it typically does.</li>
		<li>Deselect the Referenced Libraries filter (local pull down -&gt; Filters 
		-&gt; Referenced Libraries).&nbsp; With Mylar applied libraries won't blow 
		up the tree.</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Editors<ul>
		<li>Turn comment folding on to reduce clutter when using auto folding 
		(Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Folding).&nbsp; </li>
		<li>Increase the number of editors to leave open (Preferences -&gt; General 
		-&gt; Editors -&gt; Number of opened editors before closing).&nbsp; Since 
		Mylar will manage the open editors with task activation, this number can 
		be set higher or automatic closing disabled entirely.</li>
		<li>If auto folding is used, the Outline view can be closed or made a 
		fast view</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Outline view<ul>
		<li>Closed, since the Package Explorer and folded signatures should 
		provide enough context, and the in-place Outline (Ctrl+O) can be used 
		when needed.</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Team<ul>
		<li>Set Synchronize view to Change Sets mode (toolbar -&gt; Show Change 
		Sets)</li>
		<li>Use graphical CVS decorators only (Preferences -&gt; Team -&gt; CVS -&gt; Label Decorations 
		-&gt; Text Decorations -&gt; clear all but Project; Icon Decorations -&gt; enable 
		all).&nbsp; This helps reduce visual clutter.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
	<h3><a name="performance-summary">What are the effects of Mylar on Eclipse 
performance?</a></h3>
<p>The goal is for Mylar to have no noticeable effect on Eclipse's speed or 
memory usage, you do not need to increase the amount of memory Eclipse runs with 
to use Mylar, and any performance issue should be
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mylar">reported as 
a bug</a>.&nbsp; The current performance profile is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Mylar only runs if a task is active, and has no impact on Eclipse if no 
	task is active.</li>
	<li>Task context models have negligible memory overhead.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>When a task is active, additional view refresh is required to update the 
	views based on interest model changes.&nbsp; This should not be noticeable 
	on Windows where refresh is very quick, but could be more noticeable on 
	other platforms.</li>
	<li>The time to activate a task context is dominated by the time it takes 
	Eclipse to open the editors in the context.&nbsp; You can set the preference 
	for how many editors to open in the Mylar preference page (e.g. setting to 1 
	will dramatically reduce activation time, but also remove the benefit of 
	having open editors correspond to the task context).&nbsp; You can also turn off 
	editor management entirely in the Mylar Tasks view pull-down.</li>
	<li>Eclipse startup is slowed down by (4) if a task is active when Eclipse 
	is shut down.</li>
	<li>The low priority background searches that the Active Search view runs 
	can be noticeable on slower machines.</li>
</ol>

	<h3><a name="install-failure">Why does Mylar fail to install or update?</a></h3>
	<p>For supported platforms and known limitations please see
	<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php</a> 
	</p>
<p>The most likely reason is that you are using an <b>incompatible VM </b>(e.g. JDK 
1.4), in which case you'll errors like the following in your log file.&nbsp; To 
check JDK version that Eclipse was launched with to to Help -&gt; About Eclipse SDK 
-&gt; Configuration Details and verify that the java.vm.version is 1.5.&nbsp; Mac 
users should refer to the last
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=116347#c4">bug 1163477</a> 
for instructions on how to change the 1.4 default.</p>
<p>
<tt>   Root exception:
   java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/eclipse/mylar/tasklist/MylarTasklistPlugin 
   (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)
</tt>
</p>
<p>
This can also be the result of using an <b>incompatible version of Eclipse</b>.&nbsp; 
Separate versions and update sites exist
<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">for Eclipse 3.1 and for the latest 3.2 
milestone</a>), in which case you'll see errors like the following in your 
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.log file or in a Mylar view:</p>
<p>
<tt>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
   org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.FilteredTree.getFilterControl()Lorg/eclipse/swt/widgets/Text;

   org.osgi.framework.BundleException: The activator org.eclipse.mylar.java.MylarJavaPlugin for bundle org.eclipse.mylar.java is invalid
</tt>
</p>
<p>In this case the easiest thing to do is reinstall Mylar.&nbsp; <b>Your tasks won't be 
lost</b>, by default they are stored in the &lt;workspace&gt;/.mylar/tasklist.xml file 
which will be read next time Mylar starts.&nbsp;First, uninstall the old version of Mylar using Help -&gt; 
Software Updates -&gt; Manage Configuration.&nbsp; You need to first Disable on all 
Mylar features by right-clicking them, allow Eclipse to restart after the last 
is disabled, and after restart.&nbsp; Then ensure that the 3rd toolbar button is 
pressed (figure below) so that you see the disabled features to uninstall, and 
Uninstall them using the popup menu.&nbsp; If you don't uninstall the the Update 
Manager will think that you have the latest and tell you that there are no 
updates. Note that manually removing the plug-ins 
and features can lead to Eclipse configuration errors. After uninstalling update Eclipse 
by adding the correct update site specified at: 
	<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php">http://eclipse.org/mylar/dl.php</a>, 
and after that automatically or manually updating will install the correct 
version.</p>

<h3><a name="setup-linux-browser">Configuring Eclipse's Internal Browser on Linux</a></h3>
	<p>Mylar Task Management features make user of the Internal Browser.&nbsp; 
	These instructions have been tested on Fedora Core 4</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Run Mozilla (not firefox) to confirm that it works.</li>
		<li>Confirm the location of your Mozilla install ( /usr/lib/mozilla-1.7.12 
		on our test box)</li>
		<li>Set necessary environment variables in &lt;home_directory&gt;/.bashrc, 
		adding the following 3 lines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/mozilla-1.7.12<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME LD_LIBRARY_PATH </li>
		<li>Log out and log in again (or type &quot;source .bashrc&quot; at the prompt)</li>
		<li>Start Eclipse and test the internal web browser</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you are get exceptions indicating missing libraries, check that the 
	paths are accurate and that you in fact have the libraries requested. For 
	example, on our test box a library was still missing after these steps. The 
	libstdc++.so.5 was being reported as missing. To solve this problem, find an 
	rpm online that will install the missing legacy library. In our case we 
	found necessary rpm (compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-47.fc4.i386.rpm) on
	<a title="http://www.rpmfind.net/" href="http://www.rpmfind.net">rpmfind.net</a> 
	using their search facility.&nbsp; References:

<h3><a name="tasklist-blank">Why did my tasks disappear?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
<p>Either because Mylar failed to <a href="#install-failure">install or update</a>, 
or because there was a problem reading the task list.&nbsp; By default Mylar 
keeps your task list in &lt;workspace&gt;/.mylar/tasklist.xml.&nbsp; If you move 
workspaces, and have not changed the Mylar data directory via the Task List 
preference page, the new location will be used when Eclipse restarts (hit 
Restore Defaults on that page to copy tasks back to the default location).&nbsp; 
If your tasks ever disappear please
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mylar">report this 
as a critical bug</a>, and check the .mylar folder for a tasklist-backup.xml 
file, which will contain the previous state task list.&nbsp; Make sure to copy 
it somewhere it before adding any tasks or queries or restarting Eclipse because 
it will get overwritten on any modification.</p>
	<p>If your workspace folder is not backed up it is a good idea to either 
	backup the tasklist.xml file manually or periodically use File -&gt; 
	Import/Export -&gt; &nbsp;Other -&gt; Mylar Task Data.&nbsp; Note that when restoring 
	an previous tasklist.xml file you should first close Eclipse.</p>

	<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><a name="repositories-unsupported">What if Mylar doesn't support my task/bug/issue tracker?</a></h3>
<p>First, do a search of the <a href="http://eclipse.org/mylar/bugs.php">open 
bugs</a> and vote for the corresponding bug if your tracker is found, or create 
a new report.&nbsp; In the meantime, you can work with those reports (but not 
with queries) via the web integration.&nbsp; To create a task from any web-based 
repository:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drag the URL from the Address bar of the browser, or from a hyperlink in 
	a bug listing to the Mylar Tasks view.&nbsp; This will create a task for the 
	bug, link it to the page, and populate the description with the title of the 
	corresponding page.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mozilla, simply drag 
			the URL.&nbsp; In Internet Explorer you must have Ctrl pressed in 
			order for Eclipse to recognize the drop.</li>
	<li>Alternatively you can copy the URL, press the New Task button on the 
	Mylar Tasks view.&nbsp; This has the same effect as above but you can edit 
	the description after retrieving it.</li>
	<li>Opening the task will now open the corresponding issue.&nbsp; You can 
	also right-click the task and select Open in External Browser.</li>
</ul>
	<p>

	<hr>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3><a name="upgrading-repositories">How do I upgrade to multiple 
task repository support?</a></h3>
<p>Bugzilla Client users follow these steps after updating in order to 
migrate to multiple repository support from version 0.4.6 or older</p>
<ul>
	<li>After 
updating and restarting, deactivate your active task, open the Mylar -&gt; Task 
Repositories view and re-add your previous repository using the wizard.</li>
<li>Ensure that you enter the correct Server URL by pressing the &#8220;validate&#8221; button 
on the corresponding dialog, since this URL will be used for the migration.</li>
	<li>Exit the workbench and restart Eclipse to complete the migration.</li>
</ul>
	<hr>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="versions-repositories">Why is only one task appearing in Bugzilla queries?</a></h3>
	<p>This is a symptom of the wrong Bugzilla version selected in your Mylar 
	Bugzilla preferences ( Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Mylar -&gt; Bugzilla Client ). 
	For example, if you are connecting to the
	Eclipse.org Bugzilla then the 2.20 option must be selected.</p>
	<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3><a name="filtering-declarations">How do I stop declarations from showing up in the Package Explorer?</a></h3>
<p>If you don't like Mylar's constant showing of Java members in the 
			Package Explorer, select the drop-down menu, then &quot;Filters...&quot; and 
			enable the &quot;Mylar Java Declarations Filter&quot;.&nbsp; It will then 
			stick in the menu in case you want to toggle between modes.&nbsp; 
Note that this will hide interest information about members that aren't in your 
current file (e.g. showing you which methods are landmarks) so this mode is not 
recommended, but can be useful for 1024x768 screen resolutions.</p>

	<hr>
<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
			<h3><a name="active-search-empty">Why does nothing show up in the Active Search or Active Hierarchy?</a></h3>
			<p>
			As you work and elements become landmarks (bold decoration), and 
			these elements populate the Active Search and Active Hierarchy 
			views.&nbsp; To force an element to populate the views manually make 
			it a landmark by right-clicking or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow.&nbsp; 
</p>
