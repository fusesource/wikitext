      Mylar Overview</h1>
    <p>This preview release of Mylar is sparsely document.&nbsp; For questions about usage please feel free to email
	<a href="mailto:mylar@cs.ubc.ca">mylar@cs.ubc.ca</a> or
	<a href="mailto:mylar-users@eclipse.org">mylar-users@eclipse.org</a>.&nbsp;

	<p>As you work on programming tasks, Mylar watches your activity and creates 
	a task context.&nbsp; This context is associated with the task that you have 
	activated.&nbsp; Mylar extends Eclipse structure views and editors to show 
	you only what you're working on by focusing on the task context, and to 
	highlight the degree of interest of the program structure that you are 
	working on.&nbsp; The following list and figure summarize the core Mylar 
	features.&nbsp; </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use the task list to create tasks and categories.&nbsp; You can also 
		add a bugzilla report as a task, or create a bugzilla query as a 
		category.&nbsp; A task context is activated by clicking the gray 
		glasses, which causes the task and its category to become bold.&nbsp; 
		Note that tasks can show up in multiple categories (e.g. as a result of 
		a query, as in the figure below).&nbsp; To disable the context click the 
		glasses again.&nbsp; If you are using bugzilla reports you must 
		configure the Bugzilla server first (Preferences -&gt; Bugzilla).&nbsp; If 
		you double-click a Bugzilla report it will open with the internal 
		browser, or with a Bugzilla Editor if you set Preferences -&gt; Mylar -&gt; 
		Task List accordingly.</li>
		<li>Click the Mylar glasses to filter out all uninteresting elements 
		(i.e. those not a part of the task context), shown here on the Outline 
		view.&nbsp; You will notice that views with Mylar filtering update 
		automatically as you work.&nbsp; Toggle this button to switch between 
		the standard view mode and the Mylar interest filtering.&nbsp; If you 
		have no task context active and all of the Mylar glasses are toggled off 
		all of the Mylar functionality is disabled.</li>
		<li>The Problems list can be filtered just like the outline.</li>
		<li>The editor provides an automatic folding feature that can be toggled 
		using the toolbar button next to &quot;Mark Occurrences&quot;.&nbsp; When enabled 
		all uninteresting elements will be folded, an interesting elements 
		unfolded.&nbsp; Note that if you use the Mylar Java editor for &quot;.java&quot; 
		files the highest interest elements will be moved to the top of the 
		content assist list.</li>
		<li>Mylar filtering works in the Package Explorer as well.&nbsp; 
		Elements that are not a part of the task context show up in gray 
		consistently throughout the views.&nbsp; The highest interest elements, 
		called Landmarks, show up in bold.&nbsp; </li>
