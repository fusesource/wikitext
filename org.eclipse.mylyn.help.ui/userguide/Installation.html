		<h2 id="ProjectStructure">Project Structure</h2>
		<p>The Mylyn project is structured into the following update sites and distributions.  Mylyn extensions are split into two different categories.  
			<i>Connectors</i> extend Mylyn to different task management systems.  
			<i>Bridges</i> focus the artifacts that you work with when you active a task.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Main">Main</h3>
		<p>The main Mylyn update site features are mature components that are supported by the Mylyn project committers and distributed as part of the 
			<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse Downloads</a>.  
		</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Task List (Required)</b>: provides the Task List view and other task management features.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Focused UI (Recommended)</b>: provides the ability to focus the Eclipse UI on the task-at-hand
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Integration:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Connector: Bugzilla</b>: trask repository integration for the Bugzilla bug tracker
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bridge: Eclipse IDE</b>: focus for IDE features such as the navigator and marker views
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bridge: Java Development</b>: focus for the Package Explorer and Java editor
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bridge: Plug-in Development</b>: focus for PDE artifacts
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bridge: Team Support</b>: automatic change set management
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Extras">Extras</h3>
		<p>Mature components that are supported by community contributions.  You must add the 
			<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads">Extras site</a> in order to install these components.
		</p>
		<p>Integration:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Connector: Trac</b>: task repository integration for Trac
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Connector: JIRA</b>: task repository integration for Atlassian's JIRA issue tracker
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Incubator">Incubator</h3>
		<p>Incubator components vary in maturity level and are supported by the component leads.  </p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>UI Usage Reporting</b>: mature component for viewing Eclipse usage statistics
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>UI Experiements</b>: user interface tweaks, not recommended for daily use
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Integration:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Connector: Web Templates</b>: mature component with templates for connecting to web-based issue trackers, advanced user interface
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Connector: XPlanner</b>: maturing component for connecting to the XPlanner agile project management tool
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Releases">Releases</h2>
		<p>The best and most stable release to use is always the latest.  This goes for milestone releases (e.g. 2.0M1) which will often have bug fixes and other improvements over final release versions (e.g. 1.0.1).  The "milestone" tag only refers to the fact that the API for that release is still stabilizing. Our policy is not to destabilize, so any Mylyn build that you install should be stable, including development builds.  The UI of development builds can fluctuate.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Schedule</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Weekly builds: available every Wednesday and on-demand</li>
			<li>Release builds: see the 
				<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Galileo" title="Galileo">Galileo</a> release schedule
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Weekly/Integration Builds</b>
		</p>
		<p>Integration builds are released weekly and should be used by all Mylyn contributors not self-hosting from CVS 
			<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Self-hosting">straight from CVS</a>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Eclipse 
				<b>3.5</b>: latest milestone release is fully supported (e.g., 3.4M1)
			</li>
			<li>Eclipse 
				<b>3.4</b>: latest release is fully supported (e.g., 3.4.1)
			</li>
			<li>Eclipse 
				<b>3.3</b>: latest release is fully supported (e.g., 3.3.2)
			</li>
			<li>Eclipse 
				<b>3.2</b>: not suported, use Mylyn 2.0.0 (reached end-of-life)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Task List and Context Store Compatibility</b>
		</p>
		<p>The Task List and Context Store are compatible across all currently-supported Eclipse versions.  This means that you can use the same .mylyn data in both Eclipse 3.2 and 3.3.  For Mylyn versions that have reached their end-of-life we specify the update path so that the contents of the .mylyn folder are updated.  This is listed in the "Update notes" on top of the 
			<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylyn/new">New &amp; Noteworthy</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Task context compatibility</b>
		</p>
		<p>Task contexts can be shared with any previous released version of Mylyn.  Note that if elements have been renamed they may not appear as interesting when the context is activated.</p>
		<h2 id="Download">Download</h2>
		<p>For supported platforms and known limitations please see the 
			<a href="http://eclipse.org/mylyn/dl.php">Mylyn download page</a>.
		</p>
		<p>The recommended way to install Mylyn is from inside Eclipse:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select 
				<i>Help->Software Updates->Find and Install</i>.
			</li>
			<li>Select 
				<i>Search for new features to install</i> and select 
				<i>Next</i>.
			</li>
			<li>Select 
				<i>New Remote Site</i>.
			</li>
			<li>Enter "Mylyn" for the name and insert the download site given on the 
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/dl.php">Mylyn downloads page</a>.  The URL should end up as something similar to <code>
				<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/eX.Y">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/eX.Y</a>.</code> where X.Y is the Eclipse release number.
				<ol>
					<li>Eclipse 3.2: <code>
						<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.2">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.2</a></code>
					</li>
					<li>Eclipse 3.3: <code>
						<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.3">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.3</a></code>
					</li>
					<li>Eclipse 3.4: <code>
						<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.4">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/e3.4</a></code> (probably)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Select 
				<i>OK</i>.
			</li>
			<li>Make sure there is a check in the 
				<i>Mylyn</i> box, and select 
				<i>Finish</i>.
			</li>
			<li>Put a check in the box next to 
				<i>Mylyn</i>.  If you don't mind downloading some stuff you don't need, go ahead and select 
				<i>Next</i>.  Otherwise, expand the 
				<i>Mylyn</i> line (by clicking on the disclosure triangle) and select what you want.  We recommend downloading the 
				<i>Task List</i>, the 
				<i>Focused UI</i>, and connectors appropriate to the bug repository that you use -- Bugzilla, Trac, or Jira.  (Note that to download Jira, you need both the core and the connector.)  You can download Mylyn without a bug repository, but it won't be as interesting an experience. If you download the Focused UI you will want to also choose the Bridge appropraite to the content you work with. Most developers will want to include all bridges provided.
			</li>
			<li>Read the license agreements, accept or decline as appropriate, and either select 
				<i>Next</i> (if you accept) or 
				<i>Cancel</i> (if you do not accept).  
			</li>
			<li>You will see a list of features and where to install them.  If the default installation directory is fine, select 
				<i>Finish</i>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b>Optional Extras</b>
			There are optional Mylyn extras available at a separate update site: 
			<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/extras">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/extras</a>. This update site includes projects still in incubation. As of writing this update site includes the JIRA Connector, the Generic Issue Tracker Connector, and UI Usage Reporting facility.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Errors you might get during the download process:</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Network connection problems encountered during search</b> means that Eclipse couldn't find the location you entered.  This might be because you copied something incorrectly (watch for extra characters -- even extra spaces can cause errors), or because the site went down.  You might be able to see if the site is down by copying the URL into your Web browser.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Update manager failure</b> means that Eclipse could not access the update site, or that it got confused about the configuration state of your Eclipse.  First try updating again to see if the update site is accessible.  
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are trying to update the JIRA connector you can also try de-selecting that feature in case the Tigris.org update site is not accessible.  Using use 
				<i>Search for new features..</i> when installing can help to avoid this problem.  If that does not work see the 
				<a href="Configuration.html#Configuration">feature configuration troubleshooting</a> below.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>You will probably get a warning that 
				<b>the feature is unsigned</b>.  If you trust that hackers have not befouled the Mylyn plug-in, select 
				<i>Install All</i>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>You will get a dialog box asking if you would like to restart Eclipse.  We recommend that you select 
				<i>Yes</i>.  <!-- If you are running Eclipse from the command line, it might be worthwhile to start it once with  (@@@? true?) eclipse -clean -->
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Platformrequirements">Platform requirements</h2>
		<p>Mylyn requires the 
			<b>Java 5</b> virtual machine.  To check the version of the Java virtual machine that Eclipse was launched with to to 
			<i>Help -> About Eclipse SDK -> Configuration Details</i> and verify that the java.vm.version is 1.5.  
		</p>
		<p>Mac users should refer to the last comment on 
			<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=116347#c4">bug 1163477</a> for instructions on how to change the 1.4 default.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you do not have Java 5, you can download it from 
				<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun's web site</a>.
			</li>
			<li>If you have more than one VM, you need to specify that Eclipse should use the JDK1.5 VM.  </li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>We do 
			<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140955">not recommend</a> using JDK 1.6 on Eclipse 3.1.</b> (It works fine with Eclipse 3.2 or 3.3.) To use JDK 1.6 on Eclipse 3.1, you must add the following line to your config.ini file:
		</p>
		<pre>   org.osgi.framework.executionenvironment=OSGi/Minimum-1.0,OSGi/Minimum-1.1,JRE-1.1,J2SE-1.2,
   J2SE-1.3,J2SE-1.4,J2SE-1.5,JavaSE-1.6
</pre>
		<p><b> Linux and JVM issues</b></p>
		<p>For those experiencing unstable performance with Linux using the Sun JVM, download the 
			<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/download.html">IBM JVM</a>, which will require you to register with IBM prior to download.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>In Unix</b>, set the environment variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to the root of the JDK1.5 installation and/or set the <code>PATH</code> variable to put the JDK1.5 executable directory before any other VM executable directories.  For example, under <code>bash</code> in Unix:
		</p>
		<pre>export JAVA_HOME="''(location of JDK1.5 root)''"
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
</pre>
		<h2 id="InstallingonLinux">Installing on Linux</h2>
		<h3 id="Browserissues">Browser issues</h3>
		<p>Mylyn uses the Standard Widget Toolkit Browser, and users have experienced problems with the SWT Browser on Linux.  This is not a Mylyn specific problem and also occurrs if you try to use Eclipse's Browser view.  There are two options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Follow the instructions below to get the browser properly configured</li>
			<li>Disable the 
				<i>Browser</i> tab showing up on tasks via 
				<i>Preferences -> Mylyn -> Task List</i>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When the Browser is not properly configured exceptions such such as "Could not create Browser page: No more handles (<code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: ...</code>)" will appear when attempting to open tasks.  See 
			<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserlinux">the SWT Browser guide</a> for which browsers will work.  
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/">Seamonkey</a> is reported to work well. Just install and then point MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME to /usr/lib/seamonkey. (read below for example of setting this variable)
		</p>
		<p>To test to see if your browser is properly configured, select 
			<i>Window -> Show View -> Other -> General -> Internal Web Browser</i>, then try to bring up a web page.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A quick work-around is to disable the internal browser pages in Mylyn editors. To do this: 
				<i>Window -> Preferences -> Mylyn -> Tasks -> Disable Internal Browser</i>.
			</li>
			<li>Before testing the browser support in Mylyn, you must first ensure that the Eclipse internal browser is correctly configured. To test to see if your browser is properly configured, select 
				<i>Window -> Show View -> Other -> General -> Internal Web Browser</i>, then try to bring up a web page.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Notice</b>: You must use the GTK2 version of Mozilla for internal browser integration.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Notice</b>: The internal browser does not correctly support HTTPS.  See 
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80033">bug 80033</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Mylyn Task Management features makes use of Eclipse's internal browser, which may require additional install steps listed below.  You also have the option of disabling Mylyn's use of the internal browser via 
			<i>Preferences -> Mylyn -> Tasks</i>.
		</p>
		<p>The following steps have been verified on Fedora Core 5, and OpenSuSE 10.1.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Run Mozilla 
				<b>(not Firefox)</b> to confirm that it works.
			</li>
			<li>Confirm the location of your Mozilla install (ex: <code>/usr/lib/mozilla-1.7.12</code>)</li>
			<li>Set necessary environment variables in <code>&lt;home_directory>/.bashrc</code>, adding the following 3 lines</li>
		</ol>
		<pre>    MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/mozilla-1.7.12
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME
    export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
		<p>For Debian Etch and newer use the following MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME:</p>
		<pre>    MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/iceape
</pre>
		<dl>
			<dd>4. Log out and log in again (or type "<code>source .bashrc</code>" at the prompt)</dd>
			<dd>5. Start Eclipse and test the internal web browser</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>If you are getting exceptions indicating missing libraries, check that the paths are accurate and that you have the libraries required. For example, on our test box a library was still missing after these steps. The <code>libstdc++.so.5</code> was being reported as missing. To solve this problem, find an <code>rpm</code> online that will install the missing legacy library. In our case we found necessary <code>rpm</code> (<code>compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-47.fc4.i386.rpm</code>) on 
			<a href="http://rpmfind.net/">rpmfind.net</a> using their search facility.  See also: 
			<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php">Standard Widget Toolkit FAQ</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Memory consumption problem with internal browser on Linux-GTK</b>
		</p>
		<p>If you are experiencing abnormal memory consumption upon launching the internal browser (or opening repository tasks), try shutting down eclipse, renaming/moving your <code>~/.mozilla/eclipse</code> folder and relaunching eclipse. (see 
			<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=173782">bug#172782</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>No more handles error</b>
		</p>
		<pre>(java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no swt-mozilla-gtk-3449 or swt-mozilla-gtk in swt.library.path, java.library.path or the jar file)
</pre>
		<p>To resolve this error install a package that provides the Gecko engine library. On Ubuntu and Debian the package is called libxul0d.</p>
		<h3 id="RecommendedGTKSetupforKDE">Recommended GTK Setup for KDE</h3>
		<p>The recommended GTK theme to use for KDE (and KDE based distributions like Kubuntu) is the
			"Human" theme. (Possibly, this is also a good recommendation for GNOME. GNOME users, please comment.)</p>
		<p>With Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), this theme can be installed with</p>
		<pre> aptitude install human-theme
</pre>
		<p>The appearance of GTK applications is controlled by the KDE System Settings / Control Center
			in the section "Appearance".</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>GTK Styles and Fonts: GTK Styles: Select "Use another style 
				<a href="Human">Human</a>"
			</dt>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>Colors: At bottom: 
				<a href="x">x</a> Apply colors to non-KDE applications
			</dt>
		</dl>
		<p>These changes are applied to these two GTK configuration files, respectively:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><tt>$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0-kde</tt></li>
			<li><tt>$HOME/.kde/share/config/gtkrc-2.0</tt></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Solving issues with KDE environment variable settings</b>
		</p>
		<p>Most of the 
			<a href="#Known_UI_issues_with_KDE">known UI issues below</a> are due to a broken environment variable setting. The environment variable <tt>GTK2_RC_FILES</tt> contains a search path to find the GTK configuration files to be used by the GTK application and can be checked with
		</p>
		<pre> env | grep GTK2_RC_FILES
</pre>
		<p>The correct setting is obtained by</p>
		<pre> export GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0-kde:$HOME/.kde/share/config/gtkrc-2.0 ''# Bourne shell''
 setenv GTK2_RC_FILES $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0-kde:$HOME/.kde/share/config/gtkrc-2.0 ''# C shell''
</pre>
		<p>
			<b>Important note:</b> The used environment setting seems to differ depending on the way KDE starts
			the application: from Konsole, using "Run Command...", using a desktop icon etc. Please use this simple script to check the different ways:
		</p>
		<pre> #!/bin/bash
 env | grep GTK2_RC_FILES >/tmp/GTK2_RC_FILES.env
</pre>
		<p>and look at the resulting output in <tt>/tmp</tt>.</p>
		<p>Consider filing a bug against the distribution showing this inconsistent behaviour.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Known UI issues with KDE</b>
		</p>
		<p>There a couple of bugs related to UI features not working in specific Linux distributions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=176716">176716: Task colors are not displayed</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=173928">173928: Task acivate button does not work under linux</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Debian 3.1 (sarge) with KDE and standard X11 installation (XFree86) works fine for all three issues.</p>
		<p>Debian testing (etch) with KDE and new X11 installation (X.Org) has issues with the color display (bug 176716 and 135928), but the Task Activate button works.</p>
		<p>Kubuntu Dapper 6.06 with KDE and X.Org triggers all above issues. An upgrade to Edgy enables Task Color display and the date picker selection. To get the Task Activation button working you have to use Edgy and Eclipse 3.3M5eh (or newer).</p>
		<p>Kubuntu Gutsy 7.10 has issues with the color display (bug 176716). A workaround is to change the GTK-Style to "Human".
			More details and another solution in the comments of bug 176716.</p>
