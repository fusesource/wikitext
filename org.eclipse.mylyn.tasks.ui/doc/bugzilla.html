    <h2>
      Bugzilla Client Integration</h2>
			Bug reports can be opened with either the Bug Editor or the Internal 
			Web Browser.&nbsp; This can be set as a Task List preferences.&nbsp; 
			When the Bug Editor is open you can click the hyperlink to show the 
			report in the browser (e.g. to use a feature not yet available in 
			the editor, such as voting).&nbsp; <p>
			<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.mylar.doc/doc/images/0.3/bugzilla-internal-browser.gif" width="344" height="157"></p>All bug reports are archived 
			in a special category that is invisible by default.&nbsp; But if a 
			you do a search, and the matches don't show in another category 
			(e.g. because no query matches that report), the archive category, 
			highlighted in blue below, gives access to that report.<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.mylar.doc/doc/images/0.3/tasks-archive.gif" width="331" height="187"><p>If a bug report has information on it that has not been viewed, such 
			as new comments, the blue &quot;incoming&quot; overlay is displayed.&nbsp; If 
			a bug has changes on it that have been saved but have not been 
			committed to Bugzilla, the gray &quot;outgoing&quot; overlay is displayed.&nbsp; 
			A red overlay appears if there is a conflict.</p>

			Bugzilla Query dialog. This enables support of queries that can not 
			be configured via the dialog, and as such some query hits may not 
			open or format properly.<p>

			You can explicitly state 
			whether you want to work with cached copies of Bugzilla reports and 
			avoid refresh with the server.&nbsp; In offline mode the cached bug 
			copy is always used.&nbsp; In online mode the Bugzilla server is 
			always checked for the latest report.<p>
