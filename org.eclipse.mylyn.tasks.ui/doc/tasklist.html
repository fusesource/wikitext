	reports:<ul>

		<li>Create category - organize tasks and bug reports into groups</li>
		<li>Add or create new bugzilla report - add a bug report into Task List</li>
		<li>Add bugzilla query - creates a category that contains all bugzilla 
		<br>
		reports that match the query</li>
		<li>Refresh - refresh all bug reports and bugzilla queries</li>

	<h3>Tasks</h3>
	<p>A task can be created with a description and a priority level. The 
	priority level can be varied from P1 through P5 which is used for sorting 
	and filtering the Task List. A task can be set to complete by right clicking 
	and selecting &quot;Mark Complete&quot;. The completed tasks appear in the 
	Task List 
	with light gray font to distinguish it from incomplete tasks. More detailed 
	information such as notes and related links can be added to the task by 
	double clicking on the task, which will open an editor. A task can be 
	activated by selecting the glasses icon in the first column, which will 
	initiate the monitoring feature of mylar to store the task context. The 
	active task and its category will appear in bold on the task list. The 
	context stored for each task can be cleared by right clicking the task and 
	selecting &quot;Clear Task Context&quot;.</p>
	<h3>Categories</h3>
	<p>A category can be created to organize the Task List. If a category is 
	selected during task creation, the task will be added to that category. The 
	drag and drop feature of the Task List allows tasks and bug reports to be 
	moved from one category to another.</p>
	<h3>Bugzilla Reports</h3>
	<p>Bugzilla reports can be added to the Task List via two methods. An 
	existing bug report can be downloaded from a bugzilla server or a new bug 
	report can be created on a bugzilla server. The Task List shows the same 
	details for the bug report as it does with tasks, but the icons are 
	different. When the bug report is double clicked, the bug report will be 
	opened by a bugzilla editor or an internal browser, which can be toggled in 
	the preferences. A bugzilla report can be activated in the same manner as 
	tasks.</p>
	<h3>Bugzilla Query</h3>
	<p>A bugzilla query is a category that is made up of all bug reports that 
	match a specified query. When it is created, the user is presented with a 
	dialog that presents query options similar to the search page on the 
	bugzilla server. All hits form the query are added to the query and can be 
	used like standard bug reports.</p>
	<h3>Filters</h3>
	<p>Filters are available to manage the Task List. There are two filters, one 
	for filtering completed tasks, and one for filtering based on priorities.</p>
