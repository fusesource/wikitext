h1. Test Wikitext Table Features

And forgetting to leave a blank line before a table:
|| First Heading || Second Heading ||
| Fooness | Barness |

A single column table:

|| One Column ||
|A bulleted list:
* First item.
* Second item. |
|{code}
// Java - Some code here
...
{code}|

A bullet list with links:

* [link title | foo]
* [link title | bar]

And let's try a table with some nested code:

|| Code || Description ||
|Here is a code sample:
{code}
// Java
    @Override
    public boolean canStart(String line, int lineOffset) {
        blockLineCount = 0;
        headerColCount = 0;
        colCount = 0;
        rowCount = 0;
        builderLevel = -1;
        if (lineOffset == 0) {
            matcher = startPattern.matcher(line);
            return matcher.matches();
        } else {
            matcher = null;
            return false;
        }
    }
{code}
| This could be a description of the code. |
|How about putting the code for a table inside a table:
{code}
|| First Heading || Second Heading ||
| Fooness | Barness |
{code}
| And there is some flexibility about where we put the cell division pipe symbols. |

Here is a simple table:

|| First Heading || Second Heading ||
| Fooness | Barness |

And here is a fancy table that has nested structure inside it:

|| Whacky Content || 'Nother Heading ||
| Here is a nested bulleted list:
* First item.
* Second item. Make this item longer...
* Third item.  | 2nd cell |
| Another bulleted list:
* And straight...
* into the...
* bulleted list!  | 2nd cell (again!) |
| And you can do numbered lists:
# First item.
# And how about nesting again...
#* with a 
#* bulleted list | 2nd cell (encore!) |

Strictly speaking, you ought to put the line continuation symbol at the end of every nested line inside a table cell, but the table block parser is often able to cope with sloppier wikitext.

Try a table inside a bulleted list:
* First bullet with nested table:
|| First Heading || Second Heading ||
| Fooness | Barness |
* Second bullet with nested code:
{code}
// Java
    @Override
    public boolean canStart(String line, int lineOffset) {
        blockLineCount = 0;
        headerColCount = 0;
        colCount = 0;
        rowCount = 0;
        builderLevel = -1;
        if (lineOffset == 0) {
            matcher = startPattern.matcher(line);
            return matcher.matches();
        } else {
            matcher = null;
            return false;
        }
    }
{code}
* Third bullet, contains a table without headings:
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 |
| 3 | 6 | 9 |


{code}
Test escapes: \[ and \] and \\ and \{ and \}
Non escapes: [ and ] and \ and { and }
{code}

Test a literal asterisk in a list item:
* * The second asterisk in this item should be rendered as a literal asterisk.

Test whether a table can process two links inside a single table cell (this was issue CONFDOC-36).
|| A || B ||
| [AWS-SQS|AWS-SQS] / [camel-aws|aws] | Sample description. |
| And let's test using character escapes: | Escapes\|like\|this |
