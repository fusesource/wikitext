"..Mylar, arguably the most productivity-enhancing idea since background compilation and all of the things
that enables (namely refactoring and syntax hilighting).  
I just don't know how I ever was able to read and understand the Eclipse
sources (or the sources of other large projects I've worked on) before Mylar,
it's just that good."
