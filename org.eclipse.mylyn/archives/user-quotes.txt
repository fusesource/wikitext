"to really fully understand, people need to believe (or perhaps experience) that once they start thinking and working in contexts...they'll never go back.

"..Mylar, arguably the most productivity-enhancing idea since background compilation and all of the things
that enables (namely refactoring and syntax hilighting).  
I just don't know how I ever was able to read and understand the Eclipse
sources (or the sources of other large projects I've worked on) before Mylar,
it's just that good."

I would like to commend you on this very good tool. It has increased my productivity by 3 folds - no kidding... I use it to manage my subprojects & frameworks - very friendly and very useful.
