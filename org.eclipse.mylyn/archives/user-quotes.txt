"With Mylyn's growing user-base, more and more of these Trac hosting/Bugzilla hosting/Jira 
hosting/CollabNet hosting services will be put under the magnifying glass to see if their 
offerings work properly with Mylyn. It seems to me that this is just the tip of the iceberg 
with people measuring the quality of a issue tracking service based on how well it works with 
Mylyn. Is Mylyn about to become the golden standard against which all issue tracking services 
must measure themselves?"

"Mylyn is brilliant: among the other features, it provides the necessary glue to link together a programmer's everyday tasks, the CVS repository, the bug repository and the IDE!!! It is the answer to what me and my co-workers feeled we missed until some months ago!"

Mylyn [formerly Mylar] is exciting because it is so innovative. Developers are constantly seeking ways to increase their productivity, and the task-oriented user interface enhancements that Mylyn provides for the Eclipse workbench is a huge win for Eclipse de­­velopers. With Mylyn, the Eclipse IDE is clearly the most productive development environment out there.

Absolutely the authors of Mylar, a simple and effective idea and most of all a real novelty in the eclipse plugin space, their great work deserves the broadest visibility and foster integration with any version control and issue tracking system available to make eclipse the cornerstone of any kind of software factory environment.

Thanks for an excellent product
I just wanted to say that Mylar has made my life as a programmer so much easier. Indeed, after getting used to its ways, I found the costs of switching contexts greatly reduced, since you can pick up exactly where you left left. Keep going.

"I was immediately exited about idea of context focused UI and couldn't wait for the 
public preview of Mylar project after I saw slides of Mik's presentation from 
EclipseCon 2005(?). Since that public preview I've been using Mylar for my daily work, 
submitted hundreds (literally) of bug reports and enhancement requests, few dozen 
patches and even contributed whole connector for web-based issue trackers. I couldn't 
think how I was been able to work without Mylar before and believe that this is just 
the beginning, because Mylar has great potential for helping users completing their 
tasks faster. We should see more great things from Mylar team in the future."

"to really fully understand, people need to believe (or perhaps experience) that once 
they start thinking and working in contexts...they'll never go back.

"..Mylar, arguably the most productivity-enhancing idea since background compilation 
and all of the thingsthat enables (namely refactoring and syntax hilighting).  
I just don't know how I ever was able to read and understand the Eclipse
sources (or the sources of other large projects I've worked on) before Mylar,
it's just that good."

I would like to commend you on this very good tool. It has increased my productivity 
by 3 folds - no kidding... I use it to manage my subprojects & frameworks - very 
friendly and very useful.
