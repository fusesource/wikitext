This plugin depends on three Apache libraries that must be downloaded independently of Mylar.


commons-fileupload-1.1.1.jar can be downloaded from here:
http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_commons-fileupload.cgi

commons-io-1.2.jar can be downloaded from here:
http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/commons/io/binaries/

servlet-api.jar can be downloaded from here:
(I believe that you have to download the whole Tomcat install)
