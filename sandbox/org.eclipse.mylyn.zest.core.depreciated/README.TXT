org.eclipse.mylar.zest.core.depricated is a temporary project that represents the state of 
Zest on March 3rd 2007 (EclipseCon 2007).  Zest is currently being moved to a new home
(Either GEF or Nebula).  In preparation for this move, Zest has been refactored, and several
classes renamed.  If the new zest does not work for you, then this project is available, however,
please open any bugs related to backwards compatibility.
